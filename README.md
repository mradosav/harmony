# harmony
An ear trainer/chord progression generator

Harmony works by generating a chord progression and having the user guess which notes are in the chord.
On startup, you can see which notes are in the first chord in the progression. The different colors represent what function the note is in the chord
(blue is the root, green is the fifth, and magenta is for the seventh).
If you press the play button, you should hear the first chord followed by the second.
You can left click on the play field to guess which notes are in the second chord, or right click to remove notes.
When you are finished guessing, press the check button to see if you are correct. Correct notes will stay black, but incorrect notes will turn red.
If you guess all the notes, the program will generate the next chord in the progression.
